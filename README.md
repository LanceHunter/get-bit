# get-bit
A full stack application for comics and other performers

## What we are doing.
We are creating a web app for use by comics and performers who want an easy way to keep track of their material and their performances. This is a refactor/rewrite of the original GetBit (http://github.com/paige-throck/get-bit) using React Native.
