A document describing what the jQuery and other front-end javascript needs to do on each of our views.

Landing page / index.ejs (index.ejs)
- No major functionality.

Login page (login.ejs)
- No major functionality (can turn form into AJAX call, but not necessary)

Create account page
- confirm that customer has entered an email address in email field
- confirm that email addresses match in both fields
- confirm that passwords in both fields match
- Do not allow the request to be submitted without all fields filled out and appropriate fields matching
- Submit the form as AJAX POST call to /login/create

Bits page (bits.ejs) -
- take information from search bar and send it to server /bits/search
- place the information received from the server in a pull-down pane below the search bar
- ability to filter displayed bits depending on what label user selects

Review bit page (reviewBit.ejs) -
- Create a new tag field when the + button is pressed
- Ability to add a label to a bit from the pull-down menu (sending a POST request to jokes_labels)
- Ability to send an AJAX POST to /bits/labels to create an entirely new label
- Ability to receive the JSON array of labels that is the reply to creating a new label and replacing the contents of the labels pull-down menu with those results
- Ability to confirm what has changed on the bits page when the submit button is pressed, and then send a PUT request to /bits/:id with the updated information in a JSON body.

New bit page (newBit.ejs) -
- Create a new tag field when the + button is pressed
- Ability to confirm that at least the title field is filled out.
